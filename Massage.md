# Massage

## Techniques

Apply the massage oil/lubricant:
- Apply the oil to her feet and all the way up to the knees because the massage is really not just about the feet, but also about the ankles, calves, and shins.
- Use gentle rubbing movements to smooth the oil over her feet and legs. The movements also warm up the tissue and give her a chance to relax.

Gently pull the legs:
- Grab the heel using the outside hand.
- Grab the sole of the foot and across the top of the arch using the inside hand.
- Lean back the body to gently pull the leg.
- This helps relax the muscle groups around her hip.

Use thumbs to massage into the arch of the sole of her foot.

Use thumbs to massage the top of the feet.

Pull the toes gently.
