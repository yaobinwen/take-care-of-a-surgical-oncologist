# Take Care of a Surgical Oncologist

## Emotional/Psychological Support

Being a surgical oncologist, she undertakes a lot of stress from the work. She told me she would feel mournful if a patient dies because of her surgery, and when that happens, she would like to go to a remote and tranquil temple or monastery and live for a couple days to recover.

I want to learn some professional psychological therapy in order to give her emotional support in that case.

## Foot and Leg Massage

I learned that a surgeon usually needs to keep standing throughout the entire surgery, regardless the length. If the surgery takes one hour, she keeps standing for one hour; if the surgery takes ten hours, she keeps standing for ten hours.

As a result, her legs and feet are very tired after a long day. I want to give her proper foot and leg to help her reduce the fatigue.

## Life Trivia

(Well, this list is just for that surgical oncologist in **MY** home. This list is not intended for all the surgical oncologists.)

- Make her milk tea.
- Feed her a lot of milk because she likes milk.
- Feed her watermelon and cantaloupe because she likes them.
